Project Overview
This project aims to develop an AI-powered tool to assist students in creating effective outlines for speeches, papers, and other academic assignments. The tool will guide students through the process of organizing their ideas, developing main points and supporting details, and incorporating research. It will provide personalized feedback and prompts to help students improve their outlining skills and critical thinking abilities.

Project Objectives
Help students structure their ideas into coherent outlines with main points, sub-points, and supporting details
Guide students in incorporating research and their own analysis into outlines
Provide personalized feedback and prompts to improve outlining skills
Assist students with different needs, including those with disabilities or language barriers
Generate logs of tool usage to help instructors understand student progress and tool effectiveness

Current Workflow
Instructors provide outline instructions and examples to students
Students struggle to organize ideas and create proper outlines
Many students resort to using AI tools to generate initial outlines without knowing how to expand on them
Instructors manually review and provide feedback on student outlines
Key Pain Points
Students have difficulty organizing ideas into a coherent structure
Incorporating research and personal analysis into outlines is challenging for many students
Students with disabilities or language barriers face additional challenges in creating outlines
Current AI tools can generate basic outlines but don't teach students how to develop their own voice and analysis
Instructors lack visibility into how students are using AI tools and developing their outlining skills

Ideal Solution Vision
An interactive tool that guides students through the outlining process
Prompts students to narrow topics, develop main points, and incorporate supporting details
Assists with research integration and encourages critical thinking
Provides personalized feedback and suggestions for improvement
Generates usage logs for instructors to track student progress and tool effectiveness
Supports accessibility features for students with disabilities
Offers language support for non-native English speakers
